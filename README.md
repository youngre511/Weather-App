# Weather App Project

The Weather App web application provides up-to-date five-day, three-hourly forecasts based on zip code. It is built on the OpenWeatherMap Geocoding and 5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast APIs. 

The purpose for building this app during my second week of JavaScript Back-End Bootcamp was to experiment with creating dynamic websites using what we'd learned of EJS, Node.js, and Axios.
